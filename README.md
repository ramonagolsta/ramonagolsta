Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m a passionate software developer equipped witha solid foundation in PHP, MySQL, Laravel, GIT, building REST API, HTML & CSS, MVC framework.
  
- My journey as a programmer started when realized how awesome it is to write a code and see how it works. Seeing results always keeps me going!
- My tech skills: Git, PHP frameworks (OOP & MVC), Unit testing, Laravel, MySQL, Frontend.

# About my projects:
  
- Digital Wallet project. In this project I used Laravel framework and implemented basic features for user. The user can create, edit, view and delete his wallets. He can also make transactions between 2 different wallets and mark transactions as fraudulent. MySQL database is used for storing all the data.
  
- MiniBank. To achieve the desired outcome of this project, which was to create bank account, choose a currency, make transactions and buy crypto, OOP principles were implemented. As well as API integration to dynamically fetch and display real time crypto data.

- CryptoPage. For this project similar principles were applied to strengthen the gained knowledge.

  To successfully complete all these projects I implemented HTML&CSS for styling, as well as worked with multiple packages.
