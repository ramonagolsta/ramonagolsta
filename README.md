Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m a passionate software developer equipped witha solid foundation in PHP, MySQL, Laravel, GIT, building REST API, HTML & CSS, MVC framework.
  
- My journey as a programmer started when realized how awesome it is to write a code and see how it works. Seeing results always keeps me going!
- My tech skills: Git, PHP frameworks (OOP & MVC), Unit testing, Laravel, MySQL, Frontend.

- About my projects:
  Rick&Morty project. In this project an API was used to fetch data about seasons, episodes and characters. The task was to create a website where all seasons are
  displayed, all episodes in a specific season and characters in an episode displayed. MVC framework was implemented to keep the code clean and organized.
- News WebPage. To achieve the desired outcome of this project, which was to display news and provide multiple search functions (search news by topic, date and
- country), OOP principles were implemented. As well as API integration to dynamically fetch and display data.

- CryptoPage. For this project similar principles were applied to strengthen the gained knowledge.

  To successfully complete all these projects I implemented HTML&CSS for styling, as well as worked with multiple packages.
